K&R C code by me, a dumbass
===========================

This is a small repo that contains mostly small and experimental C code that
I maintain mainly as practice to keep my C skills on point. This repo is messy
and stupid and not meant to be your usual code repo in anyway or form. It's a
doodle book of sorts so of course it's messy. Initially alot of this code was
written while I was rereading Kernighan & Ritchie (78-88). There are no Makefile
here, just c code. Pick a file and gcc it, I don't care. If there are Makefiles
then it's to link code.

There are no licenses here. I don't think anyone would care if you stole someone's
scrap book. Lots of code here is in the K&R book anyway.

I don't make the distinction between other people's code and my own even though I
should, but then most of this code is (should be I hope) simple enough to not need
citation. That'd be like patenting the stick figure. I don't mean any disrespect in
not citing other's code, I'm just wayy to lazy

Style
=====

Most of the code follows a sortof linux kernel style - suckless style hybrid. Are
they good standards? I hope so. I mostly picked them because they have a reason to
be. I.E. tabs should be 8 characters since they help with clearly breaking your code
up to blocks, espcially if your dayjob is to look at blocks of code. I don't make
them 8 spaces though because if someone else prefer 4 space tabs well then they can
do that.
